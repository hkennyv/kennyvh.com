## Overview

This is a NextJS port of the popular hugo theme, [hugo-theme-terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).

It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v9.5.3 and was bootstrapped using
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It also includes one-click instructions on how to [deploy to Netlify](#how-to-start)
or [deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/more/deploy-button).

This port is still under development and has not reached feature parity
with the original theme yet. See the [TODO](#todo) section for more
information on the available features.

## Features

- **5 duotone themes**, depending on your preferences (orange is default, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice duotone**, custom syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- fully responsive

#### Code highlighting

A custom syntax highlighting based on PrismJS. All you need to do is to wrap you code like this:

````
```html
  // your code here
```
````

**Supported languages**: bash/shell, css, clike, javascript, apacheconf, actionscript, applescript, c, csharp, cpp, coffeescript, ruby, csp, css-extras, diff, django, docker, elixir, elm, markup-templating, erlang, fsharp, flow, git, go, graphql, less, handlebars, haskell, http, java, json, kotlin, latex, markdown, makefile, objectivec, ocaml, perl, php, php-extras, r, sql, processing, scss, python, jsx, typescript, toml, reason, textile, rust, sass, stylus, scheme, pug, swift, yaml, haml, twig, tsx, vim, visual-basic, wasm.

## How to start

There are two ways to get started:

### One-click deploy

The easiest way to get started is by using one of the one-click buttons below
to automatically create a new repository that looks exactly like this one for
you and deploy it to either [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

#### One-click deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/hkennyv/next-theme-terminal)

#### One-click deploy to Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hkennyv/next-theme-terminal)

### Manual clone

If you want to manually clone the repository, you can use the following
command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hkennyv/next-theme-terminal.git
```

## How to run your site

To run the site locally, you simply need to run install the dependencies and
start the development server:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

(you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed)

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:hkennyv/next-theme-terminal.git`
2. Change directories into the repository: `cd next-theme-terminal`
3. Install the dependencies and run the development server: `yarn install && yarn dev`
4. View the site at: <http://localhost:3000>

## How to configure

To configure the site, edit the `siteconfig.json` file. This allows you to
customize the site at build time without having to modify any code at all.

Here is a complete sample file:

```json
{
  "title": "Terminal",
  "subtitle": "A simple, retro theme for NextJS.",
  "keywords": ["nextjs", "theme", "retro"],
  "copyright": "",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/hkennyv/next-theme-terminal",
  "params": {
    "themeColor": "green",
    "showMenuItems": 2,
    "fullWidthTheme": false,
    "centerTheme": false
  },
  "logo": {
    "logoText": "Terminal",
    "logoHomeLink": "/"
  },
  "menu": [
    {
      "identifier": "about",
      "name": "About",
      "url": "/about"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "showcase",
      "name": "Showcase",
      "url": "/showcase"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "extra",
      "name": "Extra",
      "url": "/extra"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can edit the settings here and have changes reflected direclty in your site
(changes in `siteConfig.json` won't be reflected until you restart your
development server).

## Post archetype

This project uses [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)
to parse YAML front-matter from the markdown content. You should create your
front-matter using the following structure:

```YAML
---
title: My post title
date: 2020-09-28
author: hkennyv
authorTwitter: hkennyv
cover: /images/uploads/hello.jpg
tags:
  - me
  - life
keywords:
  - blog
  - lifestyle
description: A short description of the post!
showFullContent: true
---
```

## Add-ons

**TODO:** this is still a WIP, I plan on adding support for:

- **Comments** -- for adding comments to your blog posts
- **Extended Head** -- for extending your header
- **Extended Footer** -- for extending your footer

## How to (safely) edit the theme

To change things in the theme, you'll need to install the dependencies and run
the development server:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

You can add or modify pages in the `pages/` directory (see
[Next.JS pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for more info).

Or you can modify some of the smaller React components directly in
`components/`.

CSS is built using [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) and can be found in
`assets/css/`.

## Found a bug?

If you spot any bugs, please use [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/hkennyv/next-theme-terminal/issues) or create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/hkennyv/next-theme-terminal/pulls) to fix the issue.

## New cool idea or feature?

I'd like to keep this mostly in parity with the original hugo theme by
[@panr](https://github.com/panr), so if you havea a feature you'd like to see,
please follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal#new-cool-idea-or-feature-)
so we can get it into the original theme and this port will follow suit.
