# kennyvh.com

Welcome to my personal website! This is a project bootstrapped with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

## Running the site

### Development

To run the site for development, simply install the dependencies using:

```
yarn install
```

and then run the dev server using:

```
yarn dev
```

## WARNING

This is an old branch of my personal website, it's a NextJS port of the popular
Hugo [Codex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-codex/) theme. It absolutely
does not have feature parity with the original and some of the original styling
has been modified. Use at your own risk!
