# About me

## Background

Hey there, my name is `Kenny Huynh`.

I'm a norcal native (Tracy, CA) that moved to sunny southern california where
I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a BS Electrical
Engineering.

I have wide experience in software, devops, and embedded engineering.
I'm generally interested in supporting engineering infrastructure, tooling,
and improving developer experience (DX).

I currently work at [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/) as a Systems
Development Engineer II (SysDE) working on tools and services for internal and
external teams.

## Interests

I love staying active & trying new things. When I'm not working, you can find
me:

🏔 - hiking or camping

🏂 - snowboarding

🚲 - riding my bicycle and/or motorcycle

🏋️‍♀️ - working out

👾 - playing video games

💻 - hacking around on [various software/hardware projects](https://github.com/hkennyv)

💿 - learning how to DJ (DDJ-400 w/ rekordbox)

🍞 - loafing around with my cat, winston

Currently: dabbling in rust 🦀 (see my [advent of code progress](https://github.com/hkennyv/aoc))

## Computer nerd

I'm a huge computer nerd. I have **2** main machines that I daily drive, a
laptop and a desktop, in addition to a drawer full of raspberry pis and
microcontrollers.

My desktop is a dual-boot hackintosh with Mac OS Mojave and Windows 10. I'm
currently rocking an AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, RX 580, with 24GB RAM.

I recently upgraded my old Mid-2012 Macbook Pro (RIP) for a new 2020 Macbook
Air M1 rocking Mac OS Big Sur with 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM (read about my
[blog post](https://www.kennyvh.com/posts/upgrading-my-laptop) here). 

I'm a total hardware nerd, so if you have any questions about my setup, I'd
love to [chat](/contact).
