# About me

My name is Kenny Huynh, I work at
[**ReJoule, Inc.**](https://rejouleenergy.com/)
as a DevOps Engineer. I have a background in electrical engineering, embedded
systems, and software engineering. I love tinkering with new technologies
(both hardware and software) and I love thinking about all the ways that we
can apply these technologies to create a better world.

I'm a first gen Vietnamese-American and I'm originally from a small town called
Tracy, CA but currently reside in sunny Southern California (Garden Grove).

When I'm not working, you can find me:

🏔 - hiking and camping

🚲 - riding my bicycle or motorcycle

🏋️‍♀️ - working out

👾 - playing video games

💻 - contributing to open-source software

🍞 - loafing around with my cat

Currently: dabbing in rust 🦀
