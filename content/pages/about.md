# About me

## Background

Hey there, my name is `Kenny Huynh`.

I'm a norcal native (Tracy, CA) that moved to sunny southern california where
I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a BS Electrical
Engineering.

I have wide experience in embedded systems, software, and devops engineering.
I'm especially interested in supporting engineering infrastructure, tooling,
and anything that helps engineering teams get shxt done.

I currently work at [ReJoule, Inc.](https://rejouleenergy.com/), a small
clean-tech startup based out of southern california where we're tackling some
really interesting problems surrounding EV's and advanced battery diagnostics.

## Interests

I love staying active & trying new things. When I'm not working, you can find
me:

🏔 - hiking or camping

🚲 - riding my bicycle and/or motorcycle

🏋️‍♀️ - working out

👾 - playing video games

💻 - hacking around on [various software/hardware projects](https://github.com/hkennyv)

💿 - learning how to DJ (DDJ-400 w/ rekordbox)

🍞 - loafing around with my cat, winston

Currently: dabbling in rust 🦀 (see my [advent of code progress](https://github.com/hkennyv/aoc))

## Computer Setup

I have **2** main machines that I daily drive, a laptop and a desktop.

My desktop is a dual-boot hackintosh with Mac OS Mojave and Windows 10. I'm
currently rocking an AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, RX 580, with 24GB RAM.

I recently upgraded my old Mid-2012 Macbook Pro (RIP) for a new 2020 Macbook
Air M1 rocking Mac OS Big Sur with 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM. (I plan on writing
a blog post about this soon!)

I'm a total hardware nerd, so if you have any questions about my setup, I'd
love to [chat](/contact).
