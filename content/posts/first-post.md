# welcome to my blog

I've long blogged privately (and will continue to do so), but would love to
have a forum to do some public blogging as well (more formally than twitter at
least...).

I haven't decided yet if I want this to be a strictly technical blog or if I
want to do some personal blogging on it as well. I'm learning towards the latter
where I just dump a bunch of crap here.

I think i've changed my website at least 4-5x in the past year, so it's always
going to be a WIP.

That being said, it's a great excuse for me to play around with new
technologies. I've really been enjoying the serverless stuff lately.
There's something super satisfying about pushing code and watching your build
finish on netlify or vercel. Throw in a headless CMS, and it's almost magic
that you can have a front-end up and a pseudo back-end up without managing
any servers at all.

cheers to writing much more!
